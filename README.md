Algorithm Exercises
==================

This repository contains algorithm exercises for practicing practical algorithms.

Each file has a small test data set that needs to be processed in some way. The exercise
has a brief explanation of what processing should be done to the test data set, and a
working answer to the problem commented out at the bottom of the file.

First try to write a solution to the problem yourself. If you have trouble figuring it out,
maybe try again next day. If you are really stuck you can look at the answer at the bottom of the file.
